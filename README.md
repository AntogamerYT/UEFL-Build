# UEFL

Unreal Engine Function Loader

## Supported Engine Versions

4.8 - 5.4 

## Why Does This Exist?

Because the prick who originally made this program couldn't just add it as a feature (A SUPER SIMPLE BOOLEAN SWITCH), and instead said to use UE4SS. 

***THANKS ALOT BUTTERCUP IT DOESN'T WORK IN MY SITUATION***

So **UEFL** is just a modified version of **UEVR** without needing a STUPID HMD to use the UObjectBaseHook.

(I'm completely scrapping all VR aspects, but I'm a newborn programmer so I will for a fact miss some stuff)

## Getting Started

Before launching, ensure you have installed .NET 6.0. It should tell you where to install it upon first open, but if not, you can [download it from here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)

1. Launch UEFL.exe
2. Launch the target game
3. Restart as administrator
4. Locate the game in the process dropdown list
5. Inject

## In-Game Menu

Press **Insert** / **0** on your numpad ***OR*** **L3+R3** on an XInput based controller to access the in-game menu, which already opens by default at startup.
